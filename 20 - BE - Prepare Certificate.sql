--Backup Encryption
--1 - Prepare Certificate.sql
--The purpose of this script is to ensure that we have a valid
--certificate for taking encrypted backups.

--Check to see if you have a master key.  If you have one already, you can use it.
SELECT

--If you do not already have a master key on this instance, create one now:
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'This is where you put in a really good password.';
GO

--See if you already have a good certificate you can use.  If you have not already created one,
--you should do so below.
SELECT

--Now that we have a master key, we can create a certificate.
--You COULD use the same certificate as you used with the TDE example, but we'll use separate
--certs in this case, just to show it's possible.

--Back up the backup encryption certificate we created.
--We could create a private key with password here as well.
